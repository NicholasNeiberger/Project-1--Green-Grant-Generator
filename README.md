# ðŸŒ± Green Grant Generator (Project 1)

This is a Streamlit-based web tool that helps sustainability-focused organizations generate grant proposal prompts with ease.

## ðŸ§° What It Does

The app uses a structured form to collect key project details like:
- Organization name and mission
- Project summary and goals
- Budget, location, KPIs, stakeholders

It then creates a full, customized grant-writing prompt you can use with ChatGPT or another AI tool.

## âœ¨ Features

- Clean, easy-to-use form layout
- Real-time character counter with feedback
- Optional and required fields built in
- Copy/paste-ready output prompt

> ðŸ’¡ *This version does not yet include OpenAI integrationâ€”itâ€™s designed to help generate strong prompts that can be pasted into GPT manually.*
